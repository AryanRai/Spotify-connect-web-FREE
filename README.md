BACKGROUND
so as a Spotify user I wanted to use Spotify WITH 
MUSIC STREAMING on my raspi which had Gassistpi 
Running on it with magic mirror. Here comes the 
Problem. My Spotify premium expired AND SPOTIFY 
DOES ALLOW U TO USE THE CONNECT API FOR FREE USERS 

THIS CODE USING THE SPOTIFY WEB PLAYBACK SDK TO LOGIN AND 
STREAM MUSIC USING YOUR BROWSER FROM YOUR SPOTIFY 
ACC. IT CREATES A SPOTIFY CONNECT INSTANCE AND 
EVERYTHING ON A FREE SPOTIFY ACCOUNT.


**************************************************
NO SPOTIFY STILL HATES ME AND ALL ITS FREE USERS 

PLEASE MAKE THE CONNECT API AVAILABLE TO FREE USERS 
SPOTIFY PLEEASE


**************************************************
MY SOLUTION
I REVERSE ENGINEERED THE SPOTIFY WEB APP 
I GOT THE URL IF HOW IT GETS ITS REFRESH TOKEN USED
IN THE WEB APP AND USING THAT TOKEN IT ALLOWS U TO
USE CONNECT API AND DOESNT RETURN 403 forbidden.
