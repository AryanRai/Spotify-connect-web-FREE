# Spotify-connect-web-FREE

BACKGROUND
so as a Spotify user I wanted to use Spotify WITH 
MUSIC STREAMING on my raspi which had Gassistpi 
Running on it with magic mirror. Here comes the 
Problem. My Spotify premium expired AND SPOTIFY 
DOES ALLOW U TO USE THE CONNECT API FOR FREE USERS 
AND I KNOW WHY NOT JUST BUY IT AGAIN? BECAUSE I 
CANT. U THINK IF I COULD HAV WHY WIULD I MADE THIS 
THING EVER. so I went searching for my options.

OPTIONS
1.MAYBE USE THE SPOTIFY WEB PLAY
(JESUS SPOTIFY HATES ME) BASICALLY THERE IS A 
THING CALLED DRM CONTENT. ONLY AVAILABLE IN
'compatible' browsers WARNING IT IS NOT AVAILABLE 
ON CHROMIUM ON RASPI.

I am a stubborn person so I used this command to 
Install chromium media edition on raspi



Now Spotify works great
You can use this as the eze way if u wanna use 
Your pi as a Spotify connect client and don't wanna
Control it or play it via python or using a script
USE THIS FIR MANUAL JUST USING AS A CONNECT CLIENT.
